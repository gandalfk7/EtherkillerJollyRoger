# EtherkillerJollyRoger
logo starring all the tools needed by a System Administrator: 
* the hammer that fix things (temporarily)
* the tape that fix things (temporarily)
* the [etherkiller](http://www.fiftythree.org/etherkiller/) that fix devices (permanently)

the wallpaper contains the motto of the sysadmins: "non ex transverso sed deorsum", [latin for "down, not across"](http://lists.slug.org.au/archives/slug/2006/09/msg00039.html), that also stars on the [ASR](http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/~ingvar/asr/overview.html) [Coat of Arms](http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~djc/asr/)
